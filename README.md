# Bash Script Template

This is a bash script template that includes best practices for error handling, input validation, and logging. The template provides a starting point for creating well-structured and maintainable bash scripts.

## Error Handling

The script includes a function for handling errors and logging them to a log file. This function is triggered by a `trap` statement that captures any errors that occur within the script. The function logs the error message and exits the script with a non-zero status, indicating that an error has occurred.

## Input Validation

The script includes a function for validating input parameters. The function performs any necessary checks on the input and returns a status code indicating whether the input is valid or not. If the input is invalid, the script calls the error handling function to log the error and exit the script.

## Logging

The script logs important information to a log file, including the start and end of the script, as well as any errors that occur. This information can be used for debugging and auditing purposes.

## Usage

To use the template, simply copy the code into a new script file and customize it to fit your specific needs and requirements. The template provides a solid foundation for writing bash scripts that are well-structured and maintainable.
